              Our island resort project was a home away from home for its guests. It was a simple webpage but had many HTML and CSS features like the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>separate links to additional pages</li>
              <li>photo gallery built with custom HTML table</li>
              <li>hi-res, evenly sized photos</li>
              <li>Google fonts!</li>

              These Nordic Vacation packages project had all the amenities a person could hope for. With four different deluxe packages to choose from, there was no end to fun with this project. Built using HTML, CSS, and bootstrap, this site had many pleasant features:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>custom rows and columns</li>
              <li>wells</li>

              This wikipedia duplication project was also created using HTML CSS and bootstrap. The project turned into more of a spiritual representation of the wikipedia homepage than an exact duplication. Here are some features we used in its design:

            <ul>
              <li>nav bar with tabs</li>
              <li>search field</li>

                I studied locally at <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/" target="_blank">Portland State University</a>. There I have received a degree in Environmental Science with a minor in Biology. Before PSU I attended a Clackamas community college where I attained an Associates degree. My interest in environmental systems is still alive and well today. I specialized in watershed biogeochemistry and bio-invasion management in riparian areas, with extra emphasis on the statistical models (<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javamath/ryan/ChiSquare.html" target="_blank">chi-square</a>, <a href="http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/understanding-t-tests-t-values-and-t-distributions" target="_blank">t-test</a>, etc) underpinning results.

                In the past I worked as a humble washer of cars. From there I graduated to the big leagues of hotel valet. Concurrently, it has been common for me to have part-time or season work more in line with my environmental field. Notably I was <a href="http://www.oswegowatershed.org/" target="_blank">Oswego Lake Watershed Council's</a> first project coordinator, where I built up volunteer watershed remediation programs at various sites within the city. I also more recently served as a water quality technician with <a href="http://lakecorp.com/" target="_blank">Lake Oswego Corporation</a>, working on improving water quality for the lake itself. The key highlight of that position lies in how many and how often I got to <strong>drive the boats.</strong> Fun stuff.

                Portland is saturated with fellow Environmental Scientists. It's a fantastic city to learn about the science, methodology and discipline, however the job market is very competitive. A master's degree is the new standard for a living wage, $30,000/year, job in this region, and I have been wondering what other options may be out there. As some of my friends have pointed out, programming is <em>fun</em>, <em>useful</em> and has still <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/open-science-codefest-nexus-environmental-sciences-and-computer-programing" target="_blank">untapped potential</a> in the environmental field. I believe having a strong foundation and work experience with programming can only help my professional career. Whether I'm building websites, apps, or statistical models, I believe programming is the future for not only myself, but for the field of many scientific disciplines.

                Outside of school and work I like to either relax and have fun, or go out and have fun. Here's a list of some of my favorite things to do during these times:
