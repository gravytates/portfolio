              <p>My earliest site! Our team created the Carbon Estimator, which takes user input about their day-to-day activities to provide an estimate for how much carbon dioxide they are responsible for emitting on a monthly basis based on known standards. Awesomely, there is a simple <b>t-test</b> calculator on an additional page that can be used to compare independent groups against each other to evaluate if there's a significantly large difference between carbon emittance! Additional links provide valuable information regarding tips to reduce carbon dioxide output, why reducing carbon dioxide is important, and the methodology behind the calculator.</p>

                 I grew up in Oregon hiking the Columbia River Gorge, exploring tide pools on the Oregon coast, playing in state parks, and attempting to paint our ethereal landscapes. Appreciating natural beauty led to a passion to share it through my work. As a native Portlander with a degree in Environmental Sciences, I've worked for years in science and project management to help restore the environment. My ambition has been one of my greatest assets, and after my time working on the ground, I realized I wanted to pursue growth in the more technical aspects of my field: programming and data analysis.
               </p>
               <p class='paragraph'>
                  To further my skills, I attended the Epicodus school for software development. Seeding a thirst to continuously grow my problem-solving ability every day has been one of the greatest gifts I've received in my experience. In combining programming, art, and science, I always devote the time and care necessary to realize the project's vision and give the justice my applications, clients, and teams deserve.

                As a versatile and dedicated full-stack developer, my projects always aim to be as efficient, beautiful, and valuable as possible. My current areas of specialization include eCommerce, React-Native/Mobile, API development, Data Visualization, Mapping, and Statistical Analysis. I am always learning and refining my craft.
