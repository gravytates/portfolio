                I grew up in Oregon hiking the Columbia River Gorge, exploring tide pools on the Oregon coast, and attempting to paint our ethereal landscapes. Appreciating natural beauty led to a passion to also share it through my work. As a native Portlander with a degree in Environmental Sciences, I've worked for years in science and project management to help restore the environment. My ambition has been one of my greatest assets, and after my time working on the ground, I realized I wanted to pursue growth in the more technical aspects of my field: programming and data analysis.

                To further my skills, I attended the Epicodus school for software development. Seeding a thirst to continuously grow my problem-solving abilities has been one of the greatest gifts I've received in my experience.

                As a versatile full-stack developer, I always aim my projects to be as efficient, beautiful, and valuable as possible. My current areas of specialization include eCommerce, React-Native, API development, Data Visualization, Mapping, and Statistical Analysis. I am always refining my craft, and I believe every day is a new opportunity to be amazing and share something wonderful with the world.
