          I studied locally at <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/" target="_blank">Portland State University</a>. There I received a degree in Environmental Science with a minor in Biology. Before PSU I attended Clackamas community college where I attained an Associates degree. My interest in environmental systems is still alive and well today. I specialized in watershed biogeochemistry and bio-invasion management in riparian areas, with extra emphasis on the statistical models (<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javamath/ryan/ChiSquare.html" target="_blank">chi-square</a>, <a href="http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/understanding-t-tests-t-values-and-t-distributions" target="_blank">t-test</a>, etc) underpinning results.

          In the past I worked as a humble washer of cars. From there I graduated to the big leagues of hotel valet. Concurrently, I've commonly had part-time or seasonal work more in line with my environmental field. Notably I was <a href="http://www.oswegowatershed.org/" target="_blank">Oswego Lake Watershed Council's</a> first project coordinator, where I built up volunteer watershed remediation programs at various sites within the city. I also more recently served as a water quality technician with <a href="http://lakecorp.com/" target="_blank">Lake Oswego Corporation</a>, working on improving water quality for the lake itself. The key highlight of that position lies in how many and how often I got to <strong>drive the boats.</strong> Fun stuff.

          Portland is saturated with fellow Environmental Scientists. It's a fantastic city to learn about the science, methodology and discipline, however the job market is very competitive. A master's degree is the new standard for a living wage, $30,000/year, job in this region, and I have been wondering what other options may be out there. As some of my friends have pointed out, programming is <em>fun</em>, <em>useful</em> and has still <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/open-science-codefest-nexus-environmental-sciences-and-computer-programing" target="_blank">untapped potential</a> in the environmental field. I believe having a strong foundation and work experience with programming can only help my professional career. Whether I'm building websites, apps, or statistical models, I believe programming is the future for not only myself, but for the field of many scientific disciplines.

          Outside of school and work I like to either relax indoors and have fun, or go outdoors and have even more fun! Here's a list of some of my favorite activities:
